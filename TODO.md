## Trasportme TODO list

_General design ideas_

  1. Create pages for search, favorites, ?map

#### Page - search
  * Display inputs in the middle of the screen (google like)
  * When search button clicked animate to the top and load search results route
  * it maybe 2-4 results so make thumb nice and big
  * to the right display details of first route by default

#### Page - favorite routes
  * Favorites should load by default if not empty
  * All favorites saved in indexedDB
  * If connection let user select time and on click refresh clicked favorite
